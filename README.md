# Opaltest

- Rudimentary styling as requested
- Menu items simple plaintext- would ofc be object in reality
- Small bit of extra CSS is just in the index template file- would ofc be elsewhere in reality...
- Test coverage limited to actions/reducers and some on sample connected form component
- Wasn't exactly sure what "alerting" the manager meant, so in this limited scope it means a big red box appearing!
- Mostly stateless components for performance/simplicity

run dev with **npm run start-dev-hmr**
